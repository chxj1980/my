  and all the other people who help out on the forums to allow the devs to

Notable super awesome testers:
---------------------------------------------------
  Kyle "Kendobear" Asher - A guy who spent weeks helping test sync and timing
                           code.  This guy deserves a medal for his patience.

  D2Ultima/Frostshocker/Modnite - These guys helped me test the major network
                                  code updates, as well as helped point out
                                  compatibility issues for certain systems.
                                  The greatly improved network code would not
                                  have been possible without their testing.

  Frostshocker - Helping get rid of all elgato-related issues and allowing Jim
                 to vent about how much he hates capture devices.

  Krazy - Always an eager guinea pig.

  Any person who went through hours of testing.  Seriously, those people are
  crazy awesome and I need to remember more of their names because there are
  many of them.

  Tons of others - Thanks to everyone else on the forums for reporting bugs,
                   and thanks to all who come by chat to patiently go through
                   bugfixing and testing for me.
